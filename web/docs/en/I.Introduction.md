## I. Introduction

GBC (short for GenoType Blocking Compressor) is a blocking compressor for genotype data, which aims at creating an unified and flexible structure-GenoType Block (GTB) for genotype data in the variant call format (VCF) files. There will be a less occupation of hard disk space, a faster data access and extraction function, a more convenient management of population files and a more efficient precess of data analysis with the GTB structure compared with the conventional gz format. GBC not only contains the function of compression, decompression, data query, but also includes basic quality control, LD calculation and file management of population files with block compression structure.
